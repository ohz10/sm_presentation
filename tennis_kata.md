# Tennis Kata

In the tennis kata, we will model a game of tennis involving two players. The game begins with each player having no points, this is called "Love, Love". The scoring progression is then Love, Fifteen, Thirty, Forty. If a player has Forty points and scores, they win the game. If both players reach Forty points, the game is said to be "duece". If the game is "duece", then a player must win by two points. When a player scores in a "duece" game, they are said to have the "advantage", or "advantage player 1". If the game is "advantage player 1", and player 2 scores, the game returns to "duece". Games can therefore be infinite.

Scores:
- Love
- Fifteen
- Thirty
- Forty
