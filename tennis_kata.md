# Tennis Kata

In the tennis kata, we will model a game of tennis involving two players. 

## Regular Scoring

Scoring in tennis proceeds as follows:
- Love
- Fifteen
- Thirty
- Forty

If both players reach Forty points, the game is a "duece". Once the game has entered a "duece", the game must be won by winning two points. If the game is in a "duece" and player 1 scores a point, player one is said to have "the advantage" or "advantage player 1". Games in "duece" can be infinite.
